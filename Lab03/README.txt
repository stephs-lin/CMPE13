Provide a summary of the lab in your own words. Highlight what you thought were the important aspects of the lab. If these differ from how the lab manual presents things, make note of that.

This lab does matrix calculations and checks if the calculated matrix matches the expected matrix. The different parts of the program, do different calculations but can call each other as well.

I thought learning how to navigate through matrices was important to understand how arrays function. I also enjoyed learning how to debug my program. This allowed me to check if I was on the right track before moving on.

Describe your approach to the lab. What went wrong as you worked through it? What worked well? How would you approach this lab different if you were to do it agagain? Did you work with anyone else in the class? How did you work with them and what did you find helpful/unhelpful?

I used row column major to navigate through the matrices by using nested for loops. This worked very well for all the parts. If I were to do it again, I would have simplified my code with more loops. I had to copy and paste some parts because I wasn't sure how to implement it like in the determinant function. I did not work with anyone in class. I only received help from the TAs.


Give us some feedback. How many hours did you end up spending on it? What'd you like about it? What you dislike? Was it a worthwhile lab? Do you have any suggestions for altering it to make it better? What were the hardest parts of it? Did the points distribution for the grading seem appropriate? Did the lab manual civer the material in enough detail to start you off? Did examples or discussions during class help you understand this lab or would more teaching on the concepts in this lab help?

I spent at least 10 hours on this lab. I liked how it incorporated linear algebra in the calculations. However, those who haven't taken linear algebra yet may find it hard to understand how to do the calculations. The lab was worthwhile since learning how arrays work is quite important.
