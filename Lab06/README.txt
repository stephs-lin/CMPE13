The purpose of this lab is to learn about timers and interrupt service routines by working with microcontrollers. In this lab, we interacted with hardware by programming the pins of the I/O shield. Learning how to manipulate the bits was very important for this lab. 

For this lab, I tried to understand the relationship between the ISR and the main functions. This allowed me to understand what needs to be in the main and ISR. Before approaching the lab, I read through the lab manual so I could have any questions answered so I wouldn't waste time trying to understand what to do. I had trouble with bit manipulation when I had to light the LEDS. Part 2 wasn't difficult because in order to move the LEDS back and forth, I just need to use the left and right shift operators. But part 1 required the LEDS to be on and off for a certain amount of time, which required toggling the bits at the right time. This was a difficult because I didn't know how to toggle the bits without affecting the others. Part 4 was hard to understand. Therefore, it took more time trying to understand part 4 before starting it. If I had more time, I would be able to finish the lab but since I haven't, most of my time goes towards debugging the parts, not leaving enough time for the rest of the parts.

I finished part 1 to 3 which didn't take too long. I spent at most 6 hours for those part but understanding part 4 took about a day. I spent half a day actually working on part 4 so I didn't give myself enough time to debug. I think this was a fun lab, but I wish the TAs were available to answer my questions so I could keep moving on without getting stuck for a long time. The grading seems harsh for this lab. The discussions in class helped but bit manipulation was discussed too late.
