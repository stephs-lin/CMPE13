In this linked list lab, we deal with structs, pointers, and sorting to create doubly-linked lists. Linked lists are collection of objects that are all linked together to form a single list. However in a doubly-linked list, each item is linked to both the item before it and after it, allowing traversal through the list both ways. This lab requires us to use a given struct to create lists and connect the lists together by assigning values to the variables. To confirm that the lists are created correctly, we create a test harness to confirm the expected results. At the end, we have our Insertion and Selection sort functions sort through a list of words.

Like the last lab, I started the lab by immediately implementing the functions in the LinkedList header file. The header file contained instructions of how each function is supposed to function. I referenced the lab manual when I was unsure of what the function is supposed to do. The functions were really easy and simple to implement, but the bugs took me a while to find. Sometimes, I would insert a line of code too early or late which would cause my function to not perform correctly. Insertion and Selection were a little more difficult to implement because in order to understand why the function was not sorting correctly, you had to debug through each line of code using the variables windows. If I had more time, I would have started the lab earlier in order to have more time to debug the insertion and selection functions. I did not work with other students for this lab, only receiving help for the tutors or TAs. Insertion is faster because it uses two sets of arrays, one for unsorted and one for sorted data. Each element except the tail/head is immediately sorted into a sequence. On the otherhand, selection sort has to keep swapping elements through multiple loops until the elements are sorted out. The results of the timing experience proved the insertion sort is much faster than selection sort.

In the end, my LinkedLists functions were functioning correctly. Selection Sort also worked but I am currently working on debugging Insertion sort. I ended spending about Friday's section hours, Monday's section hours, Tuesday's section hours, and most of Wednesday on this lab. It wasn't difficult, just being stuck and waiting to receive help sucked because the line for questions are too long during every section except Friday. I recommend editing the lab manual to accomodate some last minute changes to this quarter's lab since there is some instructions left over from last year. This made understanding the lab manual confusing.
