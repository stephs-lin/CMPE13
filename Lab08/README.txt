In this lab, we decode morse code by implementing a binary tree. The main concept in this lab is the binary tree. However, we also reinforced our knowledge of state machines, pointers, and structs. By pushing a button on the I/O shield, we can feed a morse code message into the program, and have it decode the dots and dashes into actual letters. 

For this lab, I read the manual first understand the requirements and how each part connected with each other. Since we weren't given exact steps on how to go through the lab, I started with writing the library for the binary tree. I made sure each function worked, starting with TreePrint. After TreePrint worked successfully, I worked on GetLeftChild and GetRight Child. After that, I worked on TreeCreate. Once I created my own tree, I tested the function by calling TreePrint. It verified that the tree was printing correctly. Next, I worked on Morse.C
I started with MorseInit. In MorseInit, I called TreePrint to make sure the tree was printing correctly, and in MorseTest, I checked if it was returning successfully. Once confirmed, I moved on implementing the statemachine for the MorseEventChecker. I created timers like how I did in the buttons lab for each of the three timers. Next, I did the case and switch statements for each state. Next, I worked on MorseDecode, I had trouble understanding how it would traverse through the tree at first, until I realized we could use GetLeftChild and GetRight Child. I checked if there was a dot, dash, letter, or word event to return the correct type and parameter for morseEvent. I checked MorseDecode and CheckEvents and they both worked correctly. However, when I connected them both, MorseDecode would activate at the right times but it would receive the wrong argument from CheckEvents. I am still currently debugging that. I think if I had more time on this lab, I would be able to debug it. There is not much code involved in this lab, so it is hard to find the error. I worked with Chrisitan and he gave me tips on debugging. However, we could not figure it out.

I spent about 3 days on this lab which was not enough. I did not find this lab tough conceptually, but challenging to debug. The lab wasn't very interesting, but it reinforced the concepts we already learned. The lab manual covered enough material to start us off. I wish we had more time for section because we had Monday off.
